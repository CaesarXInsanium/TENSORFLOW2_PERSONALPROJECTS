# TENSORFLOW2_PERSONALPROJECTS
I used this github repository as my guide.
https://github.com/philtabor/Deep-Q-Learning-Paper-To-Code.git
In this other repo, the implementations are done using Pytorch. However in my repo I attempt to convert everything to use Tensorflow 2 instead of Pytorch as the main framework.

Files that show up in both repos are not mine.
Much of my code in basically copied from his, except for the parts that matter.

This is my first 'serious' repo. To be used as reference for past projects
#please ignore this. i do not know git yet
git push -u origin master
